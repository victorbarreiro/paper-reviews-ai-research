I have a degree in Computer Engineering (2018-2022) from the Universidade de Santiago de Compostela and I have completed the Master in Artificial Intelligence (2022-2024) at the same university. I have done professional internships at the Galician Automotive Technology Center (CTAG) and at GRADIANT, the Galician Telecommunications Technology Center, where I worked on artificial intelligence projects.

My research career began at CiTIUS, where I obtained an initiation contract that allowed me to develop my Master's Thesis in collaboration with the center. Currently, I am carrying out my PhD at CiTIUS, funded by the University Teacher Training grants (FPU 2022) of the Spanish Government. My research interests include deep learning and generative models applied to remote sensing and multispectral image processing.
